Benchmarks programs used in the Cephalopode project.

See paper.pdf for the paper.

C/fixed and C/arb contains the fixed-precision and arbitrary precision C-code, respectively.
Along with a C compiler, you also need VossII (fl) installed.

mhs_x64/[fixed|arb] contains the corresponding Haskell code.
Use make fixed to build the fixed files.

You need MicroHs (mhs) installed to compile the benchmarks.
